# learning-projects-notebooks

This repository contains the jupyter notebooks that I have made while learning to explore data and do predictions with ML models.

Some of them are written in french

The projects are the following:

* 🥪 **OpenFoodFacts:** exploration of the [Open Food Facts database](https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/).
* 🏢 **SeattleEnergyBenchmarking:** exploration of [data](https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/2016-Building-Energy-Benchmarking/2bpz-gwpy) from 2016 and prediction of energy use for non-residential buildings.
* 🛒 **Olist client segmenation:** Added to this list in january 2023. There are 3 notebooks. This was the first time I used a clustering algorithm.
