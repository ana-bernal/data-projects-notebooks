# learning-projects-notebooks

This repository contains the jupyter notebooks that I have made while learning to analyse data and do predictions with ML models.

They are written in french.

The projects are the following:

* 🥪 OpenFoodFacts: exploration of the [Open Food Facts database](https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/).
* 🏢 SeattleEnergyBenchmarking: exploration of [data](https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/2016-Building-Energy-Benchmarking/2bpz-gwpy) from 2016 and prediction of energy use for non-residential buildings.
